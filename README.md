# Application description:
Corrosion is estimated to cost industry $2.5 trillion per year, and so companies are always looking to combat it in a cost-effective manner. This app will be made to serve as a “field-guide” for materials selection, and solve two distinct business problems:

1. The app will act as a tool for someone to search through their historic database and find performance data for given material/environment combinations. For example: “Would I want to use a magnesium alloy in a seawater environment?”  

2. If the exact situation they are looking for doesn’t have data (very possible due to the many combinations out there), most likely someone in the lab will run a test to generate the data. The app will then take the user’s test result data (as a ‘created’ entry) and add it to the database for future use by other users who need to make materials selection decisions.
